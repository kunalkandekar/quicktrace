The fastest traceroute in the west*! Tired of waiting dozens of seconds - or 
even minutes - for a traceroute, when a ping to the same IP takes mere milli-
seconds? Think it's absurd that a few non-responsive intermediate hops should 
hold everything else up? Just need to get a quick idea what the IP route looks
like? Well, look no further! This code will get you a (mostly) complete route to
a given IP address in about the time it used to take you to send a couple of 
pings! Why, it's so durn fast, it oughta be called "Raceroute"!

Tested on MacOS X (10.6.8) and Linux (Ubuntu 10.10).

* As far as I know**.

** I don't know much.


WORKING
-------
This is a C++ class and command line tool for running quick traceroutes, 
discovering intermediate hop IPs as quickly as possible, at the expense of 
potentially less accurate per-hop RTTs.

It minimizes delay by sending TTL-limited packets (currently UDP) in quick 
succession without waiting for responses, and listening for ICMP response 
packets using without blocking using select. Timestamps are recorded while 
sending and receiving packets, and approximate RTTs are calculated as the 
difference in timestamps for a given TTL. Additionally, ping (ICMP echo request)
packets are also sent to the destination IP, and the final total hop count is 
estimated from the TTL of the corresponding ICMP echo reply ("pong"). Estimating
hop count from the pong TTL is trickier than it seems because different OSes
send packets with different initial TTLs. Nonetheless QuickTrace is
able to quickly make an educated guess as to the initial TTL of the packet 
(based on the ranges of TTLs the pong TTL falls in.) Another method used is to 
detect when host-unreachable ICMP responses are received, and estimate an upper-
bound for the hop count from that, since they are sent when the packet reaches 
the destination and nobody is listening on the destination port. Again, this is 
a heuristic and not a sure-fire method for many reasons. Still, these methods
enable us to quickly estimate the total path hop count. Any intermediate hops 
that fail to respond within the timeout are assumed to be non-responding and 
pre-emptively dis-regarded (these show up with IPs 0.0.0.0 and RTTs of -1 in 
the results.)

Note that final hop count estimation is prone to give incorrect results if:
1) The final hop responds with an unconventional or incorrect initial TTL.
2) QuickTrace guesses the initial TTL incorrectly. 


BUILD
-----
Run "make" to build on *nix. Still haven't tested on Windows, but would 
eventually provide e.g. a VS proj file for a Windows build. The code may or may 
not build on Win*. Although this was originally developed and tested on Win32
(Windows ME, can you believe it), subsequent changes may have broken it for 
Win* builds.


USAGE
-----
qtrace <dest-ip> [max-hops] [reps-per-hop] [timeout-ms]

If you think a few hops are incorrectly missing from the resulting path, just 
try running it again! Heck, run it 3 more times! It only takes a second or so
anyway.


ORIGIN
------
Of course, since it returns much less information and is less reliable than your
average traceroute, it's probably useful for fewer use cases. However, there is 
a reason this code does only what it does, and its speed is only a (very useful)
side-effect.

This was implemented for work related to my Master's thesis on P2P networks, 
which was pretty cool, if I do say so myself. We discovered that with knowledge 
of only the intermediate hop IP addresses and end-to-end latencies to a small 
(about 3 - 5) set of "landmark" nodes, peers joining anywhere in a P2P network 
could be efficiently routed through the overlay to their nearest IP network 
neighbor with over 95% accuracy using a completely distributed algorithm. Per-
hop latencies and DNS hostnames of intermediate hops were nice to know, but 
didn't provide any further improvements.

Since only the intermediate IPs and end-to-end pings were sufficient, the native 
traceroute utility provided by all OS's was too slow and provided way more 
information than was needed. Hence, this was developed as an alternative method 
to quickly discover only the information that was useful to us.

"PRIOR ART"
-----------
So, googling for "fastest traceroute" brought up a couple of other tools that do
something similar to QuickTrace, and apparently have been around for a while. 
However, QuickTrace is still somewhat superior, although narrowly so. Reviewing 
the alternatives, it seems the "unique selling point" for QuickTrace is how it 
intelligently knows when to terminate correctly. As described above, it 
basically does this by sending a ping in parallel with the probe packets, and 
estimating the final hop count based on the TTL of the pong packet. This lets it
terminate much faster and more deterministically, especially if all intermediate
hops also respond correctly. 

Also, the output looks more correct, since the last hop and destination IP 
address are determined from the pong (or host unreachable) packets. For example,
often a target hostname will correctly resolve to a destination IP address, and 
it is to this address that probes and pings are send. However the machine at 
that IP often does not respond to pings/probes (try probing google.com and 
microsoft.com, for example,) and hence traceroute tools do not typically display
that IP as the final hop. This is most probably because they fail to estimate 
the route hop count, and hence, even when they know the destination IP address,
they do not know at which hop to display it.

The earliest implementation I could find for a fast traceroute was here:
Project Argus - Network topology discovery, monitoring, history, and 
visualization.
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/boom/1999sp/projects/network%20topology/topology.html

Another one is here: ftrace - Fast Traceroute for Win32
http://www.r1ch.net/stuff/ftrace/
(Seems just like plain old traceroute to meâ€¦)

Yet another one:
HyperTrace

(This one is at least much faster than the one above.)

- QuickRoute

Example C++ source (testqt.cpp):
------------------------------
#include "quicktrace.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char *dest = "ncsu.edu";
    quicktrace qt;    int ret = qt.trace(dest, 32, 1);   //max 32 hops, 1 packet per hop
    unsigned int dst = qt.get_target_address();
    cout<<"\nResolved "<<dest<<" to "<<inet_ntoa(*(struct in_addr*)&dst)<<"\n"<<flush;
    
    if(ret == QTRACE_OK) {
        int hop_count = qt.get_hop_count();
        unsigned int addr;
        char *str_addr;
        for(int i = 0; i < hop_count; i++) {
            addr = qt.get_hop_address(i);
            str_addr = inet_ntoa(*(struct in_addr*)&addr);
            cout<<"\t"<<((i+1 < 10) ? " " : "" )<<(i+1)
                <<" "<<str_addr<<((const char*)(("          ") + (strlen(str_addr) - 7)))
                <<"\t"<<qt.get_hop_latency(i)<<" ms\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

Example with unresponsive intermediate hops:
--------------------------------------------
(Note the 0.0.0.0 IPs with -1 ms RTTs. Also, the total time taken is much higher
since, the code waits the entire timeout to give non-responsive routers a chance
to respond.)
